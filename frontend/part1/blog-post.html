                <h3>December 2019</h3>
                <p>
                    Since it is the holiday season, I decided to share an excerpt from a classic poem:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads. And Mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, had just settled down for a long winter's nap.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    When out on the roof there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutter, and threw up the sash.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow gave the lustre of midday to objects below, when, what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name:
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    "Now Dasher! Now Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen! To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall! Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"...
                </blockquote>
